# geometry-library (java)

this project provides a minimal 2D geometry library. It is integer-based because it is intended for applications that work on a rastered geometry (like bitmaps).

the major reason for using this library is that it is platform independ. it's not based on SWT or AWT or Android graphics or any other libraries (only java.lang and java.util)

the library provides the basic geometric classes
 + Point
